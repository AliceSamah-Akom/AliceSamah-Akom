      <h1><b><strong><i>Life Is So Short</i></strong></b><br/>
  <p>Live to please yourself because you cannot please everyone<br/>
  Always remember to do the right thing because life is so unique<br/>
  Give a helping hand when you can because you may also need help tomorrow<br/>
      Life is independence because your supporters will be no more one day<br/></p>
      <p>Think about life because there are many hidden misteries<br/>
          Accept things the way they are because they may lead you into temptation<br/>
          Be careful when you make decisions because your tomorrow depends on it<br/>
          Do well to do your best because life is all about you and not others</p><br/>
